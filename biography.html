    The Beginning
</h2>
<p>
    In the dismal, dying factory town of Indiana in 1987, around Christmas, two unlikely people happened to engage in coitus. The act produced a child, they named him Morgan. He was a pretty chill kid, by most accounts, at least for the first few years. The parents, who shant be named, didn't work so well together, but they tried their best.

<h3>
    Happenstance and Formation of Interest
</h3>
<p>
    As years went by, our main character found that he had a fondness for history, literature, comedy and shenanigans. The latter two found him some trouble a few times, but nothing too severe. As time went by his interests were expanded and by the time he reached early adulthood technology was also encompassed by his sphere of interest. He also found that he had an extreme distaste for speaking of himself in the third person, as this biography might suggest.

    Getting Up To Speed

<p>
    After working for several years in factories and essentially treading water, Morgan because yearning for something better, something bigger, for fulfillment. He enrolled in Ivy Tech in Indianapolis and began pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Science. Three years later, and thus three years into his degree, he toured a medical lab and decided he absolutely hated the prospect of doing that for his entire life. He began pursuing other routes and came to Kenzie Academy. He is currently writing this biography and wrestling with a distaste for speaking at length about himself and putting it on the internet.
